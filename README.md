quickerNES
============

quickerNES is an attempt to modernizing and improving the performance of quickNES, the fastest NES emulator in the interwebs (as far as I know). The goals for this project are, in order of importance:

- Improve overall emulation performance even more
- Modernize the code base with best programming practices, including CI tests, benchmarks, and coverage analysis
- Add support for more mappers, controllers, and features supported by other emulators
- Improve accuracy, if possible

The main aim is to improve the exploration performance of my TASing bot, [JaffarPlus](https://github.com/SergioMartin86/jaffarPlus). However, if this work might help with homebrew emulation and other people having more fun, then much better!
